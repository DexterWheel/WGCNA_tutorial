               ###Weighted gene network construction requires a soft thresholding power Î² to which co-expression similarity is raised to calculate adjacency. 
                
               ###It is suggested to choose the soft thresholding power based on the criterion of approximate scale-free topology. We refer the reader to that work for more details  zhang and horvath 2005; 
               
               
               ###the function pickSoftThreshold performs analysis of network topology and aids the user in choosing a proper soft-thresholding power. 
               
               ###The user chooses a set of candidate powers (the function provides suitable default values), 
               ###and the function returns a set of network indices that should be inspected, for example as follows:
               
               # Choose a set of soft-thresholding powers
               powers = c(c(1:10), seq(from = 12, to=20, by=2))
               
               powers
               
               # Call the network topology analysis function
               sft = pickSoftThreshold(datExpr, powerVector = powers, verbose = 5)

##               #We have chosen the soft thresholding power 6, a relatively large minimum module size of 30, and a medium sensitivity (deepSplit=2) to cluster splitting. 
               
##               ###The parameter mergeCutHeight is the threshold for merging of modules. 
               
##               ###We have also instructed the function to return numeric, rather than color, labels for modules, and to save the Topological Overlap Matrix. 
               
##               ###The output of the function may seem somewhat cryptic, but it is easy to use. 
##               ###For example, net$colors contains the module assignment, and net$MEs contains the module eigengenes of the modules.
               
#Important#    ###A word of caution for the readers who would like to adapt this code for their own data. The function blockwiseModules has many parameters, and in this example most of them are left at their default value.
               
#Important#    ###We have attempted to provide reasonable default values, but they may not be appropriate for the particular data set the reader wishes to analyze.
               
##               ###We encourage the user to read the help file provided within the package in the R environment and experiment with tweaking the network construction and module detection parameters. The potential reward is, of course, better (biologically more relevant) results of the analysis.
               
##               ###A second word of caution concerning block size. 
##               ###In particular, the parameter maxBlockSize tells the function how large the largest block can be that the readerâs computer can handle.
               
##               ###The default value is 5000 which is appropriate for most modern desktops. Note that if this code were to be used to analyze a data set with more than 5000 probes, the function blockwiseModules will split the data set into several blocks. This will break some of the plotting code below, that is executing the code will lead to errors. Readers wishing to analyze larger data sets need
               #to do one of the following:
              
##               #â¢ If the reader has access to a large workstation with more than 4 GB of memory, the parameter maxBlockSize
##               #can be increased. A 16GB workstation should handle up to 20000 probes; a 32GB workstation should handle
##               #perhaps 30000. A 4GB standard desktop or a laptop may handle up to 8000-10000 probes, depending on
##               #operating system and how much memory is in use by other running programs.
               
               ###â¢ If a computer with large-enough memory is not available, the reader should follow Section 2.c, Dealing withlarge datasets, and adapt the code presented there for their needs. In general it is preferable to analyze a data set in one block if possible, although in Section 2.c we present a comparison of block-wise and single-block analysis that indicates that the results are very similar.

               ###We now calculate the adjacencies, using the soft thresholding power 6:
               
               softPower = 6;

               ###To minimize effects of noise and spurious associations, we transform the adjacency into Topological Overlap Matrix, and calculate the corresponding dissimilarity:
               
               # Turn adjacency into topological overlap
               
               TOM = TOMsimilarity(adjacency)

               ###We now use hierarchical clustering to produce a hierarchical clustering tree (dendrogram) of genes. 
               
               ###Note that we use the function hclust that provides a much faster hierarchical clustering routine than the standard hclust function.
               
               # Call the hierarchical clustering function
               geneTree = hclust(as.dist(dissTOM), method = "average")

               ###The clustering dendrogram plotted by the last command is shown in Figure 2. 
               
               ###In the clustering tree (dendrogram), each leaf, that is a short vertical line, corresponds to a gene 
               ###Branches of the dendrogram group together densely interconnected, highly co-expressed genes.
               
               ###Module identification amounts to the identification of individual branches (âcutting the branches off the dendrogramâ).
               
               ###There are several methods for branch cutting; our standard method is:
               
               ###Dynamic Tree Cut from the package dynamicTreeCut.

               ###We quantify associations of individual genes with our trait of interest (weight) by defining Gene Significance GS as (the absolute value of) the correlation between the gene and the trait. 
                 
               ###For each module, we also define a quantitative measure of module membership MM as the correlation of the module eigengene and the gene expression profile.
                 
               ###This allows us to quantify the similarity of all genes on the array to every module.

               ###Using the GS and MM measures, we can identify genes that have a high significance for weight as well as high module membership in interesting modules.
               
               ###As an example, we look at the brown module that has the highest association with weight.
               
               ###We plot a scatterplot of Gene Significance vs. Module Membership in the brown module:
               
               
               module = "brown"

               #The plot is shown in Fig. 2. Clearly, GS and MM are highly correlated, illustrating that genes highly significantly associated with a trait are often also the most important (central) elements of modules associated with the trait.

          ###Our previous analysis has identified several modules (labeled brown, red, and salmon) that are highly associated with weight.
               
          ###To facilitate a biological interpretation, we would like to know the gene ontologies of the genes in the modules, whether they are significantly enriched in certain functional categories etc

          #4.a   Output gene lists for use with online software and services
          #====     
               
               ###One option is to simply export a list of gene identifiers 
               #that can be used as input for several popular gene ontology
               #and functional enrichment analysis suites such as David or AmiGO. 
               
               ###For example, we write out the LocusLinkID (entrez) codes for the brown module into a file:
               getwd()
               # Read in the probe annotation
               annot = read.csv(file = "data/GeneAnnotation.csv")
               
               # Match probes in the data set to the probe IDs in the annotation file
               probes = names(datExpr)
               probes2annot = match(probes, annot$substanceBXH)
               
               # Get the corresponding Locuis Link IDs
               allLLIDs = annot$LocusLinkID[probes2annot]
               
               # $ Choose interesting modules
               intModules = c("brown", "red", "salmon")
               
               for (module in intModules){
                 # Select module probes
                 modGenes = (moduleColors==module)
                 # Get their entrez ID codes
                 modLLIDs = allLLIDs[modGenes]
                 # Write them into a file
                 fileName = paste("C:/Users/Dexter weighell/Documents/Biology/Yr 4/Project/R/tutorial/WGCNA_tutorial/LocusLinkIDs-", module, ".txt", sep="")
                 
                 write.table(as.data.frame(modLLIDs), file = fileName,
                             row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
               }
               
               # As background in the enrichment analysis, we will use all probes in the analysis.
               fileName = paste("LocusLinkIDs-all.txt", sep="");
               write.table(as.data.frame(allLLIDs), file = fileName,

               ###The WGCNA package now contains a function to perform GO enrichment analysis using a simple, single step.
               
               ###To run the function, Biconductor packages GO.db, AnnotationDBI, and the appropriate organism-specific annotation package(s) need to be installed before running this code.
               
               ###The organism-specific packages have names of the form org.Xx.eg.db, where Xx stands for organism code, for example, Mm for mouse, Hs for human, etc.
               
               ###The only exception is yeast, for which no org.Xx.eg.db package is available; instead, the package carries the name org.Sc.sgd.db.
               
               ###Please visit the Bioconductor main page at http://www.bioconductor.org to download and install the required packages.
               
               ###In our case we are studying gene expressions from mice, so this code needs the package org.Mm.eg.db.
               
               ###Calling the GO enrichment analysis function GOenrichmentAnalysis is very simple. 
               
               ###The function takes a vector of module labels, and the Entrez (a.k.a. Locus Link) codes for the genes whose labels are given.
               
               
               GOenr = GOenrichmentAnalysis(moduleColors, allLLIDs, organism = "mouse", nBestP = 10)
               
               #The function runs for awhile and returns a long list, the most interesting component of which is:
               
               tab = GOenr$bestPTerms[[4]]$enrichment
               
               #This is an enrichment table containing the 10 best terms for each module present in moduleColors.
               
               #Names of the columns within the table can be accessed by:
               names(tab)
